Problem Statement :
 Traditional static billboards in out-of-home spots tend not to engage people with relevant
 content because they do not change based on demographic data or emotional states.
 This may sometimes mean lost opportunities for brands seeking to connect with their
 prospect customers, hence less impact and efficiency of the advertising campaign.

Solution:
 A dynamic ad system using image prediction and computer vision can watch the
 demographics and sentiment of people walk in digital billboards or other advertising
 displays. The system would also be able to adapt content on the fly, ensuring that the
 audience receives more personalized and relevant advertising.
 
Our model- Dynamic Personalised Advertisement 
 The new dynamic ad system, being able to predict images and work with computer vision, can infer the data
 about demographics and sentiments of individuals walking by digital billboards or any other display. By
 changing the content in real-time, this will be able to give out very personalized and relevant ads that will work
 better with audiences.
 
HOW IT WORKS
1.Data Collection:
 Cameras and Sensors: Either the billboards themselves, or sensors/cameras placed near those billboards, record
 the image and take videos of people.
 Environmental Context: This would be in data relating to time, weather, and location from sensors that help
 facilitate perfect ad personalization.
2.Cameras and Sensors: 
 Cameras integrated into digital billboards or installed around a display for advertisements capture pictures and
 record videos of people passing by.
 Environmental Context: The contextual information can be gathered by sensors, such as time of the day,
 weather, and place, to make the ad more personalized.
3.Image Analysis: 
 Sophisticated algorithms extract facial features and identify age, gender, and ethnicity to ensure
 that ad content 
 relevant.
4.Emotion Recognition: 
 Audiences' facial expressions are detected to determine whether they are happy or interested, and
 ads are chosen based on this information.
5.Content Adaptation and Real-Time Adjustment: 
 The ads adjust themselves dynamicaly based on demographic and emotional analysis, such as showing hip
 gadgets to young adults or warm beverages on a cold day.
6.Data Anonymization: 
 Data anonymization uses anonymized personal data to create aggregate demographic and emotional information.
 Consent management requires clear consent mechanisms, data colection information, and opt-out options for ethica
 personal data use.
